Sr. No |	What Students will do?| What Simulator will do?| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--------------------------------|-------------
1.|  Student will click on start button | Simulator will show the start simulator button | To start the simulator
2.|Student will select the right answer for the statement | Simulator will show the question with various options to be selcted by the student. If the ans is correct, simulator will take to next page, if not, a message saying retry will appear. If the answer is again wrong, the simulator will prompt the hint saying read the theory and again take the simulator.| To remember Norton's Theorem, KCL and KVL.
3.| Student will select correct option for given question. |Simulator will show the question based on identifying circuit component along with given options.|To identify various electrical circuit components.
