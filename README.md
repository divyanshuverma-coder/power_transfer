<b> Experiment|     <b> To Verify Maximum Power Transfer Theorem in DC Circuits.


### About the Experiment : 
The main aim of the experiment is to verify maximum power transfer theorem in DC circuits. In any active linear bilateral network, maximum power will be delivered to the load resistance only when the load resistance is equal to theveninâ€™s equivalent resistance (Rth) or internal resistance.
